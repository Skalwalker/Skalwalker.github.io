During the pandemic, the availability of testing methods was one of the main challenges in containing the virus. Therefore, I designed C19-Audit, a framework to evaluate if cough audio is sufficient to detect COVID and analyze whether the CNN approach can overcome the SVM.",

Where will we be if countries disregard the agreement? I decided to simulate global warming as a relationship between CO2 emissions and world deforestation. Considering that the countries continue their historical trends, simulation results expect the world to reach the temperature recommendation in 2064.",
