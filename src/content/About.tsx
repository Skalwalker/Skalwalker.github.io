    text: "I believe my core attributes are defined by my personality. I am passionate about the idea of machines learning to facilitate human tasks, as long as it is developed in a humanitarian and egalitarian way. My greatest strength is my way of approaching a problem, thinking outside the box, trying to solve a problem in innovative ways, rather than brute-forcing through code. Finally, but most importantly, I consider it crucial to stay with who I am, do my hobbies, be connected to nature, and enjoy my free time. This is what keeps my gears running, helping me to be extremely productive when needed."

    text: "My name is Renato Nobre, I came from the far lands of Brasília, Brazil. A place ruled by government and bureaucracy. In this place, I got my Computer Science Bachelors, at the University of Brasília (UnB). During my period I focused my studies on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. While I was there I also enrolled in extracurricular activities, I need to gather more skill points to improve my specialization and also farm some reputation for my name. I joined a robotics competition team, I became a tutor for multiple classes, and I made undergraduate scientific research in machine learning. Meanwhile, I needed to gather more gold coins, for that I worked in a socio-environmental company, I developed an iOS App, and I worked as a researcher in natural language processing. Now I am looking for new horizons, new adventures, I am looking to become a Master or a Doctor.",
