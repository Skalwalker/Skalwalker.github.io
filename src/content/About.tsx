Since beginning my undergraduate in computer science, I have been interested in research. Over time, I developed my skills in the field and decided that I wanted to work in research-oriented companies. Since then, I have constantly been looking for opportunities and preparing my curriculum for applying to these companies. I have already participated in publishing five papers while also having multiple practical projects with a plethora of technical skills"

    text: "My name is Renato Nobre, I came from the far lands of Brasília, Brazil. A place ruled by government and bureaucracy. In this place, I got my Computer Science Bachelors, at the University of Brasília (UnB). During my period I focused my studies on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. While I was there I also enrolled in extracurricular activities, I need to gather more skill points to improve my specialization and also farm some reputation for my name. I joined a robotics competition team, I became a tutor for multiple classes, and I made undergraduate scientific research in machine learning. Meanwhile, I needed to gather more gold coins, for that I worked in a socio-environmental company, I developed an iOS App, and I worked as a researcher in natural language processing. Now I am looking for new horizons, new adventures, I am looking to become a Master or a Doctor.",
