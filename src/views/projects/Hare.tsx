                        The study of financial markets and potential predictions of exchanges allow investors to increase their profits and better understand their investments' behavior. Among different types of financial markets, the stock market stands out in popularity. This market negotiates fractions of company assets, denominated stocks, or other publicly listed companies' financial instruments. Investors trading their stocks in the market are guided by some form of prediction or analysis, such as studying the price's behavior or reading the company's economic report.

                        This work supports the hypothesis that it is possible to model a high-accuracy service to predict the stock's movement and trade market assets based on technical and fundamental<sup>1</sup> analysis. AURORA is based on a rational agent, a computational entity capable of perceiving the market and acting upon its perception autonomously. As proof of concept, AURORA was designed to operate a swing trade on a portfolio on the B3 stock exchange, the Brazilian market. The considered portfolio had shares of 3 Brazilian companies: Petrobras (PETR3), Ambev (ABEV3), and Vale S.A. (VALE3).

                        AURORA takes advantage of time series from historical data of assets and fundamental analysis variables in its investment process. Through an LSTM, time series are used to predict a given asset's value. On the other hand, the fundamental variables observe the existence of possible risks in the asset. Such information is used as input to a deep reinforcement learning model to manage the investor's resources in his portfolio. As a result, AURORA was designed into three modules: (i) the <b>Insider</b>, a predictor module that can predict the stocks' movements; (ii) a <b>risk management module</b> to deal with market volatility through the news and (iii) an <b>agent module</b>, a rational actuator that aims to allocate the resources available to the agent and act upon them. The Figure below shows an overview of AURORA's service and operation.

                        To interact with the reinforcement learning algorithm, it was necessary to develop an environment simulating the B3 stock market. This environment is designed for training and testing the DDPG model and defines the state space, action space, and reward function. The following definitions were used:

                        The dataset used to feed the service of AURORA was obtained manually from the B3 official website<sup>2</sup>. The website provides daily information from assets since 1986, such as company name and code, stock code, market type, pricing, number of trades, and volume traded with paper. AURORA's model uses a semester time window for training, validation, and testing. In our approach, the agent's portfolio comprised the VALE3, PETR3, and ABEV3 assets. We made predictions on the assets' closing price as it reflects the day's movements in the market. The label of our data was created using a discrete approach for each asset at each time step, indicating whether an asset will gain or lose value.
                    </ProjectParagraph>
                    <ProjectParagraph>
                        The validation of our proposed service was then broken down into two individual validations. First, we analyzed whether the Insiders could predict the stock direction correctly. Second, we uncovered whether the DDPG ResAM would be able to handle a portfolio allocation, given that it knows when stock will increase or decrease in value.

                        Concerning the ability to predict the movement of a stock, the objective was to determine if it was feasible to model an LSTM in a decision system like AURORA. Each stock was trained using the hyper parameterization process's best settings<sup>3</sup>. The experiment consisted of K-fold cross-validation, with k = 6, for multiple window sizes.

                        Next, we needed to evaluate AURORA's efficiency in resource allocation. The objective was to prove that AURORA could manage a portfolio with multiple assets in a stock market. Therefore, we compared AURORA with the Savings Profitability and a buy and hold strategy<sup>4</sup>. The table below presents the parameters established to carry out the experiments. We used the following performance measures to evaluate the efficiency of AURORA: profit, profitability, return and yield.

The agent's initial investment money was defined as R$ 50,000.00, allowing for multiple investment possibilities. The figure below shows the behavior of the average return during the experiments.

                        To compare AURORA's profit to a buy-and-hold strategy is necessary to create such a comparison portfolio. When an investment with more than one asset is created, the possibility of portfolio compositions is endless. In this project, the comparison portfolio created was based on the Markowitz Mean-Variance theory [3]. It states that the construction process of an optimal portfolio considers the quantification of each asset's profit and risk with the objective of creating a frontier of the most efficient portfolios [3]. This frontier is presented with the set of portfolios that theoretically provides the higher return with the lowest risk. Markowitz's efficient frontier for the selected asset composition is shown in the figure below. The color of each portfolio combination is related to an indicator that helps to find a balance point between risk and return, called Sharpe ratio [4]. We then calculated the efficient frontier with a set of 25,000 random simulations. For the comparison, we considered two portfolios with the lowest risk and the highest Sharpe ratio, represented by the green and red markers. The lowest risk portfolio estimates a half-yearly return of 1.18%, with a risk of 45%. On the other hand, Sharpe's highest ratio portfolio has a potential return of 4.28%  with a risk of 80%.

                        The table below shows the results obtained from the AURORA portfolio, comparing it with the efficient frontier portfolios and the savings. If the investor decided to migrate to the lower-risk portfolio, the investor would obtain a total yield of -R$3000.00. The investor who decided to take the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio would lose R$3,984.00 of the money invested. In contrast, AURORA made a profit of R$5,874.00, a return of 11.74% more significant than the actual and projected returns of the portfolios considered efficient. The yield obtained is also 250.44% greater than the savings yield.

                        Experimental results show that the proposed service can predict the gain or loss of value at the price of a stock with an accuracy higher than 82.86% in the worst case and 89.23% in the best case. Furthermore, the proposed service can achieve profitability of 11.74%, overcoming fixed-income investments and portfolios built with the Markowitz Mean-Variance model. These results corroborate the hypothesis that AURORA is a reliable service to trade assets in the stock market with high precision and stability.

                        In future works, we propose a rational model for the RMM, better-using information from fundamental variables. Furthermore, future research can also implement the following: hyper-parameterization of the DDPG using Hyperopt, experimenting with more input features for the LSTM model, studying possible reformulations of the B3 environment, and discretizing the actions space to implement the Deep Q-Network algorithm.

                The insider module is one of the central rational modules. Its task is to support the resource allocation model, predicting the movement of a specific stock. Insider units gather their data from the database of a stock exchange, where multiple pieces of information are available to be used as input, such as closing and opening prices and volume. The prediction made by the Insider takes the shape of a binary value, one indicating that a stock is increasing in value and zero showing a decrease.

                In our service, Insiders were modeled based on an LSTM, a gated RNN network. Gated RNNs were chosen because of their principle of creating paths through time with derivatives that neither vanish nor explode [2]. With this, the LSTM can decide what information it wants to keep or forget, aiming at improving the decision-making process's accuracy.

                Decisions made by the agent are supported by its Resource Allocation Model (ResAM). The module receives as input information on the direction of the stocks provided by its Insiders and information from the RMM, which decides whether an asset is a liability that could place the agent's profit in jeopardy. After learning, the model decides which asset should be sold or bought at each step. AURORA's ResAM was modeled based on a deep reinforcement learning model, denominated Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). In such, the entity will need to learn how to map the market's state with responsive actions, aiming to increase its profits and reduce risks.

                    We analyzed how AURORA's LSTM model behaved in an actual market situation. The goal was to understand the behavior of the predictions over the days. As can be seen in the results, the accuracy was satisfactory for all evaluated stocks. In the worst case, we obtained an accuracy of 80% for VALE3. In contrast, ABEV3 and PETR3 achieved 88% and 93% accuracy, respectively. Despite the promising results, it is noted that the LSTM has a limitation in predicting sudden movement direction changes. On the other hand, in the stock's continuous movements, the modeled LSTM showed great accuracy and ensured that its previous errors did not affect its performance.

                The figures below present the loss value behavior in 5000 epochs of training. In the top right, the boxplot shows the dispersion of the cross-validation accuracies for each time-step size. We can notice that over time, such models converged and stabilized before completing 500 training seasons. These findings indicate the ability to generalize models to predict the movement of a given stock without overfitting. Additionally, due to the boxplot's interquartile amplitude, we can infer that it is possible to model an LSTM in AURORA with a stable, high-accuracy prediction.
